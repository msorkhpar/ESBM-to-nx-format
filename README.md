# ESBM-to-nx-format

Converting ESBM dataset files to NetworkX graph format.

## Purpose

This script converts the [ESBM benchmark](https://github.com/nju-websoft/ESBM/) files to the WikES graph format. The
NetworkX graph format generated by this script is used by
the [wikes-toolkit python package](https://github.com/msorkhpar/wiki-entity-summarization-toolkit) and tries to make it
easier to use ESBM datasets alongside with WikES published datasets.

## GraphML Format

We've also provided the graphs in GraphML format and can be found in
the [releases](https://github.com/msorkhpar/ESBM-to-nx-format/releases/tag/ESBM) page.
